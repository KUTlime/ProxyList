# Proxy List

> A list of public HTTP proxy. Updated and tested daily. **See the file** `ProxyList.txt`.

## About

This list is an aggregation of several other resources of public proxy lists. Even proxies from online lists like `www.freeproxy.net` which were tested couple second ago didn't worked for me.  
The resource aggregation, the availability test and the list publishing is done every day.

### Why this list?

I wasn't able to find any easy-to-download and reliable resource of public proxies. So, I made one for myself.

### How is the availability of proxy tested?

A proxy must respond to request within 15 second and it has 3 attempts to do so. The target is `www.seznam.cz`.

### Is it guaranteed that the proxies from the list will work?

Nope. Any proxy from the `ProxyList.txt` can actually stop to work or stop to respond to requests anytime between the update interval.
